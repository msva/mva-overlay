# Gentoo repo "mva"
# About
This repo is kinda my "sandbox" and contains:
- ebuilds for packages not yet ready to be added to Gentoo repo
- temporary fixes of packages in Gentoo repo that I can't touch to avoid bureaucracy
- and/or packages that would never and up in Gentoo repo because of any reasons
- (or packages I forgot about for a long time ago)
